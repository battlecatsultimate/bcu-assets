backremwarn= oldest backup(s) will be deleted when BCU is closed, will it be fine?
backinfwarn=Backups will be created without any limit, this may affect computer storage in future. Will it be fine?
tip0=If you lose a battle, you can use a continue by pressing 4! Will not work if it's a No Continues stage, though...
tip1=Running low on Memory space? If your PC is 64-bit, try installing the 64-Bit version of Java.<br>If not, the BCU Discord server has this handy tool called run.bat to help out.
tip2=Don't push the devs to do whatever you feel like suggesting.<br>Developers are humans who made this software out of their own will, not robots.
tip3=Want to turn off those boxes below your units?Go to config page and turn off show axis! Though here's a fun fact:<br>Those boxes are actually each unit's hitbox and attack hitbox.
tip4=Don't give up just because your creations aren't good enough.<br>Everyone started being bad at all of this at some point.
tip5=It's okay to cry. It's okay to run away. You were not made that strong.
tip6=No more BCU until you do your homework!
tip7=Want to learn how to animate in BCU? Try copying some of the existing unit/enemy<br>animations and see how they work! Or try making a simple anim and fiddling with<br>the values.
tip8=A little briefing on easings: 0 is linear movement, 1 is instant movement (great for Frame-By-Frame components),<br>2 is exponential and is affected by parameter, 3 is polynomial, and 4 is sinusoidal.
tip9=Time in BCU is measured in frames. 30 frames = 1 second.
tip10=This program is completely free to use and open-source. If you paid for this, you got scammed.
tip11=Proc Immunities and Proc Blockers are not the same thing.<br>One protects only the unit immune, the other protects all of the units hit by the attack.<br>Same thing than wave immunity vs wave shield.
tip12=Procs with negative durations will not override the already existing proc if their duration is lower.<br>Useful to make entities with low proc durations not mess up debuffing
tip13=In order to play other people's packs, you need to create<br>a folder named packs within your BCU directory and drop .pack.bcuzip files there.<br>For .bcupack files, create a folder named pack instead.
tip14=Right-click on a unit or hold shift while clicking an unit<br>or it's respective hotkey to automatically spam them.
tip15=In battle, there's a variety of hotkeys that are convenient to know.<br>q/w/e/r/t deploy row 1 units, a/s/d/f/g deploy row 2 units, a switches rows in 1 row mode,<br>1 levels up Worker Cat, 2 fires the Cat Cannon, 3 toggles Sniper Cat On/Off,<br>and 4 let's you use a Continue.
tip16=In order to have experience on what everything does and know well where<br>to start, we reccomend playing The Battle Cats first before messing with this program.
